# text-generation

This project uses keras to train a LSTM network with writings of Nietzsche, 
allowing us to produce writings like him.


## train network

By running `train.py`, you can download the learning data and train the network.

```bash
python3 train.py
```

## data preparation

`download.py` retrieves text data of Nietzsce's writings and transforms it into training data.

+ question
: retrieves sequences of 60 letters from data, and transforms it into vector using "bag of words" approach for each letter (rather bag of letters).

+ answer
: transforms the letter next to the retrieved sequence, and transforms it into one-hot vector.

## prediction

The writings are produced from sequence of 60 letters (called seed). 
The next letter is decided probabilistically by applying a parameter called temperature to the softmax output of the model.

It is defined like this. 
```python
import numpy as np

def reweight_distribution(original_distribution, temp=0.5):
    """
    higher temps result in more unexpected(creative) results
    :param original_distribution: softmax output of model
    :param temp: temperature
    :return:  new distribution (sum equals to 1)
    """
    distribution = np.log(original_distribution) / temp
    distribution = np.exp(distribution)
    return distribution / np.sum(distribution)
```
